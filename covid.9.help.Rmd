#### Description

The iTrack Covid is App is developed to extend the efforts of the international data science  and machine learning community in tracking and forecasting of the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic.
It uses open COVID-19 data-sets to enable automated search, visualization and prediction of information related to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic around the globe, at national and local levels.
<!-- help predict further propagation of the pandemic around the globe. -->

The App is not meant to replace other Apps and Dashboard, such as those provided by the official data providers, but rather aims at supplementing those with additional details and insights. 
<!-- and helping citizens and decision-makers around the planet  -->
<!-- to be better informed on what is happening on a local and global scale. -->
<!-- to make better decisions on how to act locally and think globally -->
<!-- to act locally and think globally -->

The population estimates included with this map are outdated, so we used StatCan 2018 Health Region Population estimates.

In terms of our data source's reliability, PHAC is using our data to some extent. They cite it in one of the figures from their latest modelling release.

Happy to discuss this further.

### Help

The App is designed to be fully automated in finding high-risks zones in any region of the world.
The only required setting is the _region_, which is set by default to _Europe._ 
The criteria for defining the risk can be changed by using the _"Sort results by:"_ radio buttons or using the API URL command line described in [API shortcuts].


#### Terminology

The types of data are processed by the App:

- _Infected_, the same as _Confirmed_ (denoted as `confirmedXXXX`in  the App output), refers to the statistics related to the number of officially confirmed infected cases, as filed by regional Heath Offices and submit to the centralized COVID data repository. Note in reality,  the number of infected is likely larger (potentially much larger) than that recorded by  Heath Offices, as many people may carry the infection without realizing it and not having sympthoms.

- _Mortality rate_ , the same as _Death Rate_ (denoted as `deathRate`in  the App output), is  the ratio of total Death cases to total Infected cases


- _Speed_ of pandemic spread is the average number of new cases per day and is the derivative of Total


- _Acceleration_ of pandemic spread is the average daily change in speed, i.e., in the average number of new cases per day, and is derivative of Speed

- _Growth_ is another metric to measure acceleration, used in epidemiology (as the base of the exponential in exponential growth of the pandemic). It shows the ratio of the average number cases today to the average number cases yesterday.

In the iTrack COVID App, _Speed_ , _Acceleration_  and _Growth_ are computed using differential calculus, where  raw data are processed using a convolution filter, which computes the weighted average of raw dta over the sliding window, the size of which can range from 2 days to 2 weeks and can be controlled using the  "averaging window filter" slider in the "Trends" Tab. The default filter size is 1 week (7 days). 



#### Tabs

The summary of the search results is shown in the [Today] Tab as a graph  where the _Speed dynamics _(i.e. the number of new cases as day), and the change in speed since yesterday  are plotted  for the Top search results. Note that sorting of the results along the vertical lines is controlled by the _Sort results by:_ buttons. 
<!--  -->

More details analysis of pandemic spread dynamics and forecasting is provided in [Trends] Tab. In this Tab, you can view how various dynamics parameters, such speed, acceleration, growth, change over time, and what they are forecasted to be tomorrow, based on the prediction models built by the App. A number of computation and visualization parameters can be controlled from this Tab. Note that sorting of the results on this page is also controlled by the _Sort results by:_ buttons.

[Map] Tab shows the Dashboard and the Geographic Map of search results. 
Note  that Dashboard shows *combined* numbers of the search results. It may aggregate combination national results with and local results and thus may be larger than the actual  numbers at local level. 
Please click anywhere on the map to remove all pop-ups which are shown at the start. Then you can move mouse over the detected regions (marked as circles) to see a one line daily summary for each region. Clicking on it again will show the complete daily report for the region.
Note only the regions that contain Geographic data are ploted in the [Map].

[Tables] Tab shows all computed statistics in a table of format - for interactive search and printing.
For definitions of variable names, please refer to [Terminology] page.

#### Additional documentation and training

Please see [LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interactive-web-app-visualize-predict-spread-covid19-gorodnichy/) for more details and examples.

<!-- #### Other versions and releases -->

<!-- You can also run other versions and releases of the App using the following syntax:  -->
<!-- [https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/v005.Rmd](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/v005.Rmd).   -->
<!-- See [Release Notes ] for more details on each of version and release. Some releases are region specific and are more stable than others. -->

<!-- #### R101 tutorial version -->

Additionally, 
a simplified version of this App, for US only,  is developed as part of the *"Lunch and Learn: R101"* tutorial, organized by Dmitry Gorodnichy for the  [R Ottawa ](https://ivi-m.github.io/R-Ottawa) community. This version is  assessible at 
[https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/us.Rmd](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/us.Rmd). 
You can follow the tutorial at 
[R Ottawa - R101](https://ivi-m.github.io/R-Ottawa/101.html) portal.



###  API shortcuts

Starting from version 0.0.7 you can launch iTrack COVID App for a specific region and  menu settings with shortcut URLs using the API syntax as illustrated below. 
You can also start the App at any  particular Tab, e.g.,  Today, Map, Trends (Forecast), Tables, or Full Report. 

This makes it possible to bookmark the URL that is of particular interest to you on your phone or desktop - so that the App starts automatically for  your region and your settings. Try making COVID Foreacts page your home page, while during the Pandemic, just like you would have a Weather Forecast page.

**Shortcuts:** 

- [https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/?region=Europe&N=50&national=1](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/?region=Europe&N=50&national=1): Open data for Europe and find worst 50 regions there, at National level, using the default search criteria, which is `confirmedSpeed`

- [https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/?region=Europe&N=50&national=1&sortby=confirmedSpeedPerMil](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/?region=Europe&N=50&national=1&sortby=confirmedSpeedPerMil): The same as above but search using the `confirmedAccel.PerMil` criteria.

- [https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid?region=US&N=50&ascending=0&normalize=1&national=0&sortby=confirmedSpeedPerMil](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/?region=US&N=50&ascending=0&normalize=1&national=0&sortby=confirmedSpeedPerMil):  This will    open data for US `region=US`and find the top 50 regions `N=50`, sorted in descending order, i.e., from worst to best (`ascending=0`), using the `sortby=confirmedSpeedPerMil` criteria, and with national aggregates not included `national=0`. 

- [https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid?region=Europe&national=1#section-trends](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid?region=Europe&national=1#section-trends): This will open the [Trends] Tab showing the dynamics for the worst regions in Europe, found and sorted using the default search criteria.

Other shortcuts:

- [https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/?region=Asia&national=1](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/?region=Asia&N=50&national=1)

The order of listed arguments in URL does not matter.  The list of available search criteria is provided below. 


``` 
"Name" = "region",
"Latitude* " = "lat",
"Longitude* " = "lng",
"INFECTED total" = "confirmedTotal",
".. per million*" = "confirmedTotalPerMil",
".. a day (Speed)" = "confirmedSpeed", 
".. a day per million*" = "confirmedSpeedPerMil",
".. a day change (Acceleration)" = "confirmedAccel.",  
".. a day change per million*" = "confirmedAccel.PerMil",
".. daily Growth" = "confirmedGrowth.",
".. daily Growth change" = "confirmedGrowth.Accel",
"DEATHS total" = "deathsTotal",
".. per million*" = "deathsTotalPerMil",
".. a day (Speed)" = "deathsSpeed",
".. a day per million*" = "deathsTotalPerMil",
".. a day change (Acceleration)" = "deathsAccel.",
".. a day change per million" = "deathsAccel.PerMil"
".. daily Growth" = "deathsGrowth."
".. daily Growth change" = "deathsGrowth.Accel",
"Mortality rate" = "deathRate"
```

Example: `N=50&sortby=confirmedAccel.PerMil` will find Top 50 regions where the _density of the daily acceleration of INFECTED (Confirmed) cases per million_ is the highest. 

For the definition of all search metric see [Terminology] page.

*Note: density (i.e., per million) results are available only for those regions/cities where population information is provided. Normally, all country-level data provide this information, whereas city-level data often do not include this information. Similarly, Latitude and Longitude data is not available for some city-level data
